refactor: Refactor API client to use global instance

- Replaced ApiClient class with a global axios instance to simplify the architecture.
- Centralized authentication token injection and error handling using Axios interceptors.
- Introduced a `useApiClient` hook to initialize the global API client with the authentication token provider.
- Simplified `problemService` by removing the class-based implementation and using the global API client.
