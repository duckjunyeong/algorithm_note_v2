feat: Add interview chatbot and refactor Redis service

- Introduced an interview chatbot feature with a detailed prompt in `application.yml`.
- Refactored Redis operations by creating a generic `RedisService` for hash-based storage, improving code structure and reusability.
- Updated `ProblemService` to use the new `RedisService`.
- Enhanced the `GeminiClient` to be more flexible by accepting code directly instead of a URL.
- Aligned frontend API configurations with backend changes.
- Updated the code analysis flow documentation.
